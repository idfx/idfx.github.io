# Exquisite Corpse

For the [exquisite corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse), the team decided to create a collaborative space as a creative outlet for the students of our master’s program.

This short time-lapse video created with screen captures of the website, shows what we collected during the course of about a week:

Here’s an extract of the original description that was included in the website:

The exquisite corpse is a private shared space for the 54 students of the [cdm](https://thecdm.ca)’s cohort 9. We sought to address the need of artistic forms of social communication. We saw this project as an opportunity to build an elegant and compelling experience.
