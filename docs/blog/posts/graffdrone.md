# GraffDrone

This project was born from the desire to make graffiti more accessible. The dream is to one day be able to attach several cans of paint to a UAV and program it to create art on inaccessible places.

During the summer of 2015, I was lucky to work on this project as part of the Computational Poetics course at [SIAT](https://www.sfu.ca/siat.html). I started with the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 because it is lightweight and cost-effective, and also it has a very active hacking community ([The NodeCopter](https://x.com/nodecopter)). After some investigation, I decided that the logo language was a good candidate to make the definition of fly patterns more accessible to the general public. However, it needed a friendly interface for the end user to create their own designs. I came across the work of [Max Ogden](https://maxogden.com) but the logo interpreter needed to be modified so the drone would create the patterns vertically, not horizontally.
