# LiveCity

As cities grow, spaces become tighter. We have an opportunity to be more efficient with the use of these spaces based on their availability outside of operating hours. As residential spaces get smaller, the need for activity spaces outside the home gets bigger. The idea behind this project was to create a beautiful web portal to help educate the public about the possibilities.
