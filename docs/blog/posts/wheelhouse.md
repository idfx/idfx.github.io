For the RCMP St. Roch Wheelhouse and Interactive Model exhibits we recreated the experience of sailing the St. Roch through the Northwest Passage.

The team painstakingly crafted a comprehensive 3D model of the boat, recreating every historical detail with precision and care. This digital reproduction is presented on a large, intuitive touch screen interface that invites visitors to explore the vessel's various components, architectural features, and historical significance. Users can navigate through different sections of the boat, examine intricate details up close, and gain insights into its construction and purpose that might be difficult to appreciate when viewing the physical artifact. This interactive digital experience significantly enhances accessibility, providing an immersive educational opportunity for those who cannot access the original boat due to geographical, physical, or conservation-related limitations.

Building upon our detailed 3D reconstruction, we've developed an immersive interactive wheelhouse experience that transports visitors into the captain's position at the helm of this historic vessel. Using the same meticulously crafted digital model, this simulation allows users to take command and navigate the treacherous waters of the Northwest Passage—a journey that tested the limits of both ship and crew in its time.

The experience features authentic replicas of navigation instruments, weather conditions based on historical records, and realistic sailing mechanics that respond to user input through an intuitive interface. Visitors can experience firsthand the challenges of ice navigation, harsh Arctic conditions, and the critical decision-making that characterized these pioneering voyages.

This interactive wheelhouse installation serves as both educational tool and time machine, offering insights into maritime history, navigation techniques, and the human story behind these remarkable expeditions. For those unable to access the physical vessel or sail these remote waters themselves, our simulation provides an unparalleled opportunity to connect with this significant chapter of maritime exploration in a deeply personal and engaging way.
