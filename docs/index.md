# Hello! üëãüèæ I'm Juan
(pronounced as /hw…ëÀên/). And yes, that's me in the picture!

## A little about me.

I'm a tech problem-solver who enjoys diving into challenging projects. Whether it's hardware or software, I love finding creative ways to tackle complex challenges. Every new project is a chance to grow, and I'm always ready to jump in, adapt, and bring something unique to the table. For me, work isn't just about getting things done. It's about pushing boundaries and enjoying the journey of creating something meaningful and impactful.

## About what I do.

These are some of [my projects](/blog). Enjoy!

## Great! Let's talk.
