This digital reproduction is presented on a large, intuitive touch screen interface that invites visitors to explore the vessel's various components, architectural features, and historical significance. Users can navigate through different sections of the boat, examine intricate details up close, and gain insights into its construction and purpose that might be difficult to appreciate when viewing the physical artifact. This interactive digital experience significantly enhances accessibility, providing an immersive educational opportunity for those who cannot access the original boat due to geographical, physical, or conservation-related limitations.</p> <p>Building upon our detailed 3D reconstruction, we've developed an immersive interactive wheelhouse experience that transports visitors into the captain's position at the helm of this historic vessel. Using the same meticulously crafted digital model, this simulation allows users to take command and navigate the treacherous waters of the Northwest Passage\u2014a journey that tested the limits of both ship and crew in its time.</p> <p>The experience features authentic replicas of navigation instruments, weather conditions based on historical records, and realistic sailing mechanics that respond to user input through an intuitive interface. Visitors can experience firsthand the challenges of ice navigation, harsh Arctic conditions, and the critical decision-making that characterized these pioneering voyages.</p> <p>This interactive wheelhouse installation serves as both educational tool and time machine, offering insights into maritime history, navigation techniques, and the human story behind these remarkable expeditions. For those unable to access the physical vessel or sail these remote waters themselves, our simulation provides an unparalleled opportunity to connect with this significant chapter of maritime exploration in a deeply personal and engaging way.</p>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#images","title":"Images","text":"<ul> <li> RCMP St Roch Deck</li> <li> RCMP St Roch Bell</li> <li> RCMP St Roch Schematic</li> <li> RCMP St Roch Stern</li> <li> RCMP St Roch Model</li> <li> Wheelhouse recreation</li> <li> Wheelhouse recreation installation</li> <li> Wheelhouse recreation exhibit</li> <li> RCMP St Roch Interactive Model</li> </ul>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#videos","title":"Videos","text":"","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#location","title":"Location","text":"<p>Vancouver, BC</p>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#client","title":"Client","text":"<p>Vancouver Maritime Museum</p>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#date","title":"Date","text":"<p>April 2015</p>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>https://vanmaritime.com</li> </ul>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#technical-environment","title":"Technical Environment","text":"<p>Unity3D, Arduino, Rotary encoders, Optical sensors</p>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#awards","title":"Awards","text":"<p>Accepted to ACM SIGGRAPH Student Work Exhibit 2015</p>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/2015/04/01/rcmp-st-roch-wheelhouse-and-interactive-model-exhibits/#finalist","title":"Finalist","text":"<ul> <li>Unity Awards 2015: Best VizSim Project, Best Student Project, Community Choice.</li> <li>Vancouver UX Awards 2015 \u2013 UX by Students Category</li> </ul>","tags":["Unity3D","Arduino","Rotary encoders","Optical sensors"]},{"location":"blog/archive/2021/","title":"2021","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2018/","title":"2018","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2017/","title":"2017","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2016/","title":"2016","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2015/","title":"2015","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2014/","title":"2014","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/augmented-reality/","title":"Augmented Reality","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/projection-mapping/","title":"Projection Mapping","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/depth-cameras/","title":"Depth Cameras","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/rfid/","title":"RFID","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/robots/","title":"Robots","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/location-aware/","title":"Location Aware","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/web/","title":"Web","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/uavs/","title":"UAVs","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/diy/","title":"DIY","text":""},{"location":"blog/page/2/","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"blog/page/3/","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2015/page/2/","title":"2015","text":""}]}
